## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS




### What I learned

The importance of version control. Committing  all changes step by step. This helped me see the issues has the arised and what I should've done to fix it.

using Grid for the main layout and using flex box to organise the elements.

Javascript was used to add the functionality of the buttons. Originally I repeated the code for each button but I realised that I could simply this by using one. 




### Continued development

Continuing buiding similiar projects with css and javascript.
